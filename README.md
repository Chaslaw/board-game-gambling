Simple board sample of footbal matches with Start, Update and Sort buttons

#First I start with a simple layout wuth a START button, Football teams and initial results 0 - 0
#Later on I worked on logic how to put an initial game into the board, and how to initialize result of 0-0 for every single game
#Next issue was how to manage exact games, and update and make summary of the game of every single game
